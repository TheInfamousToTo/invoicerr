# Portugal e-invoicing in Invoicerr

:::tip[Invoicerr supports Portugal]
Portugal is one of five countries with data files in the per-country catalogues, so the application
runs for a company established there. Support is per mechanism, not a single yes or no.
:::

Portugal's B2G entry (selling to a government client) names FE-AP as the transmission platform, and
UBL 2.1 as the format it carries; there is no channel mandate for an ordinary B2B seller. `fe-ap` is
not backed by a transport this app talks to yet, so a send to a government client is refused, naming
the channel, rather than silently falling back to email. The AT monthly declaration now carries each
document's real ATCUD and declares credit notes too (as `NC`, referencing the invoice they correct).
See [Compliance - Portugal](/compliance/pt) for the full, sourced picture.

This page is a pointer by design. Everything Invoicerr knows about Portugal lives in its own data
files, and two pages already say it without anyone retyping it:

- [Portugal in the country compliance matrix](../country-support/pt.md) — every mechanism, and the
  catalogue each answer comes from, regenerated from those files on every docs build.
- [Compliance — Portugal](/compliance/pt) — the same coverage, written for someone deciding whether
  to use Invoicerr in Portugal.

To widen that coverage, or to add a country of your own, see [Adding a
country](../adding-a-country.md): the catalogue files listed on every other page in this directory
are the ones Portugal already has.

## Fallback payment term

The `paymentTerms.fallbackTerm` entry of `countries/data/pt.json` is the 30 days an invoice's due
date falls back to when the company has no default term of its own (see [Payment
terms](../../user-guide/settings/payment-terms.md)). Decreto-Lei n.º 62/2013, art. 4.º, n.º 3,
alínea a) makes late-payment interest due 30 days after the debtor receives the invoice when the
contract sets no date (`basis: "latePaymentThreshold"`). It sets no payment term. The application
counts the 30 days from the invoice date, not from receipt of the invoice.

## Private clients and the NIF

The NIF/NIPC scheme (`LEGAL_ID` in the `identifiers` section of `countries/data/pt.json`) is
required of a company and optional for an individual (`requiredFor: ["COMPANY"]`). Código do IVA
art. 36.º, n.º 5, alínea a) asks for the identification number of the acquirer only when it is a
taxable person (« adquirente sujeito passivo do imposto »), and n.º 16 makes a private buyer's NIF
mandatory on the invoice only when that buyer asks for it. A private client can therefore be saved,
and invoiced, without a NIF; one entered is printed on the invoice.

## Company-law mentions

The `companyLaw` section of `countries/data/pt.json` prints, under the seller's name on invoices,
quotes, credit notes and purchase orders, from Código das Sociedades Comerciais artigo 171.º:

| Legal forms | Printed | Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| every sociedade | "Sociedade por quotas, matriculada na Conservatória do Registo Comercial de Lisboa sob o número de matrícula e de identificação de pessoa coletiva 500000000" | 1 |
| por quotas, unipessoal por quotas, anónima, em comandita por ações | "Capital social 5000.00 EUR" | 2 |
| same | "Capital realizado …", only when filled in ("se for diverso") | 2 |
| Empresário em nome individual, other forms | nothing | artigo 171.º binds sociedades |

The registration number is the NIPC, the `LEGAL_ID` identifier, since artigo 171.º names one
"número de matrícula e de identificação de pessoa colectiva". The sede is the company address. Not
modelled: the capital próprio owed when it is at most half the share capital, and liquidation. Text
